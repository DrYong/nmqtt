Welcome to the nMQTT .Net MQTT Library.

To Build
--------

On Windows--
Install the .Net SDK and run msbuild against the Build.sln or BuildWithTests.sln.
or
Load into Visual Studio and build.

On Mac OS X or Linux--

1. Install the latest and greated Mono release (http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html)
2. Install the MonoDevelop IDE (http://monodevelop.com/)
3. Load the .sln into MonoDevelop and build.

Not sure whether it is possible to run Xunit and hence the unit tests on non windows platforms yet (I haven't tried).
